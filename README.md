## Basic Overview - [Live Demo](https://react-shopping-cart-67954.firebaseapp.com/)

This simple shopping cart prototype shows how React components and Redux can be used to build a
friendly user experience with instant visual updates and scaleable code in ecommerce applications.

  #### Features

- Add and remove products from the floating cart
- Sort products by highest to lowest and lowest to highest price
- Filter products by available sizes
- Products persist in floating cart after page reloads
- Unit tests, integration tests, api tests and e2e testing
- Responsive design

## Pre-requisites: Below are the system requirements to build this project.
 #### Install below
 - This app has been tested working in node version v10.1.0.
    - Download and install node version 10.1.X
    - Check node version with node -v to confirm the installed version.
    - Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it


## To build the application, some node modules are required. 
 #### First, Install the needed packages, run the below command, this takes all the required packages from package.json file located in project root folder*/

npm install

## After all the required packages are installed successfully. Start both Node and React with the below command. This will start the application at port: 3000 with url: http://localhost:3000/ 

npm start

## Running tests

#### Unit and Integration tests

###### To run unit and integration tests, run the below command. All components have at least a basic smoke test. Integration test includes fetch product and add to cart properly.
npm run test

#### Run below for Istanbul code coverage test.
npm run test:coverage

#### How effective are the unit tests, that can be evaluated by running mutation tests with Stryker. Run below to run stryker on the unit tests
- Install stryker: npm install -g stryker-cli

npm run stryker

- Stryker reports can be found at ./reports/mutation/html/index.html

#### Run below command to gather web page performance stats with lighthouse-ci
- Install lighthouse : npm install -g lighthouse-ci

npm run lighthouse

#### Run in-sprint load tests with Artillary
- Install Artillery : npm install -g artillery

npm run artillery

#### Run below clinic for monitoring the server stats against the load tests
- Install clinic: npm install -g clinic
- Install benchmarking tool Autocannon : npm install -g autocannon

 run clinic doctor --autocannon [ / ] -- node ./server/app.js

-Reports are created under ./clinic folder

#### E2E TESTS

###### We have used 'testcafe' to run e2e tests. Run below command to run end to end tests. It uses the .testcaferc.json file in the project root folder to fetch testcafe runtime configuration

npm run test:TestCafe 

 ##### Test scenarios: Following functionalities have been tested as part of e2e testing
- Add and remove products from the floating cart
- Sort products by highest to lowest and lowest to highest price
- Filter products by available sizes
- Products persist in floating cart after page reloads

Test report(using HTML reporter) can be found : ./e2e/cafe/reports/tc_report.html 
To open the report, browse to the folder and open the report in any HTML browser like chrome/Safari

#### API TESTS

###### We have used SuperTest/Mocha to do the api testing. Run the below command to execute the 
npm run test:SuperTest
##### Test scenarios: Following functionalities have been tested as part of api testing
As this api only returns all the products in the db/xml. There is no operation defined on the api. The scope of testing was limited.
-  Validate the api responds with 200 status code.
-  Count the api returns all the products available
-  Validate all the products returned with all the fields/tags required in the UI

API test results can be found at : ./APITestResult
